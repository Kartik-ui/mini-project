            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>Nowadays Phishing becomes a main area of concern for security researchers because it is not difficult to create the fake website which looks so close to legitimate website. Experts can identify fake websites but not all the users can identify the fake website and such users become the victim of phishing attack. Main aim of the attacker is to steal banks account credentials. In United States businesses, there is a loss of US$2billion per year because their clients become victim to phishing [1]. In 3rd Microsoft Computing Safer Index Report released in February 2014, it was estimated that the annual worldwide impact of phishing could be as high as $5 billion [2]. Phishing attacks are becoming successful because lack of user awareness. Since phishing attack exploits the weaknesses found in users, it is very difficult to mitigate them but it is very important to enhance phishing detection techniques.</p>
            <p>The general method to detect phishing websites by updating blacklisted URLs, Internet Protocol (IP) to the antivirus database which is also known as â€œblacklist" method. To evade blacklists attackers uses creative techniques to fool users by modifying the URL to appear legitimate via obfuscation and many other simple techniques including: fast-flux, in which proxies are automatically generated to host the web-page; algorithmic generation of new URLs; etc. Major drawback of this method is that, it cannot detect zero-hour phishing attack.</p>
            <p>Heuristic based detection which includes characteristics that are found to exist in phishing attacks in reality and can detect zero-hour phishing attack, but the characteristics are not guaranteed to always exist in such attacks and false positive rate in detection is very high</p>
            <p>To overcome the drawbacks of blacklist and heuristics based method, many security researchers now focused on machine learning techniques. Machine learning technology consists of a many algorithms which requires past data to make a decision or prediction on future data. Using this technique, algorithm will analyze various blacklisted and legitimate URLs and their features to accurately detect the phishing websites including zero- hour phishing websites.</p>
